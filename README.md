# Two-up-college-final
auzie gambling game called two up, tasked with creating a java representation of it 

## ISSUES
ever since i added a rematch/respin function the money/bet ammount will not save after the respin
will update once its fixed -- Fixed 18/07/25

22/07/25
Final polish since itâ€™s due tomorrow

-- Removed most comments I personally use  a couple friends 
 said it might cost me points
-- Changed int $ to double for decimal inputs
--Added a value check to block word inputs
-- Reworked rematch question so it loops until answered correctly
-- Added overflow block for huge bets
-- Added negative value block

Think i hit everything that could make it crash or fail
